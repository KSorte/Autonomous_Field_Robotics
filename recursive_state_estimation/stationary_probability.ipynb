    "### How did you initialize the simulation?\n",

    "I am initializing the simulation with a state (sunny, rainy, cloudy) and a belief for each of these states.\n",
    "The belief represents what the system \"thinks\" of the current state.\n",

    "### How many transitions did you consider before taking a result?\n",
    "The Markov Chain seems to converge to a stationary distribution after 10-20 steps. However, for a more accurate distribution, 1000 or 10000 steps are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How many simulation runs?\n",

    "Xt is the belief at time t and Xt+1 is the belief at time t + 1 adter applying the transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The belief X converges for this Markov chain after an infinite number of transition (~100 transitions practically).\n",
    "Thus, the equation at convergence becomes:\n",
    "X_converged = P_transpose*X_converged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The X_converged that satisfies this equality corresponds to the Eigen Vector of P_transpose for Eigen Value 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a closed form solution to find the static distribution, one must needs find the eigen vector corresponding to Eigen Value 1 and normalize it to represent probabilites.\n",

    "First ascertain if the matrix P_transpose is diagonalizable.\n",
